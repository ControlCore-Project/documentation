Installation
=====
To use CONTROL-CORE, first install its dependencies using pip:

.. code-block:: console
 
 $ pip install -r requirements.txt

At this point, as we rapidly develop CONTROL-CORE, it remains a private repository in GitHub, although we aim to clean up the source code and make it public soon. Therefore, certain steps must be made to checkout the source code, since GitHub has discontinued password-based cloning.

.. code-block:: console

 $ git clone git@github.com:ControlCore-Project/concore20.git
 
 $ cd concore20
 
 $ pip install -r requirements.txt
