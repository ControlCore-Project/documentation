Services
------------

To develop workflows in the CONTROL-CORE framework, one must go through two steps. First, to develop the services following the concore protocol. Second, is to create a workflow from the concore services. 


Workflows
------------
CONTROL-CORE provides a workflow composer, known as DHGWorkflow, to create such workflows graphically.
