Introduction
------------

CONTROL-CORE is a framework for peripheral neuromodulation control systems, which consist of models of organs called physiological models (PMs) and controllers that interact with PMs.


Services
------------

To develop workflows in the CONTROL-CORE framework, one must go through two steps. First, to develop the services following the concore protocol. Second, is to create a workflow from the concore services. 


Workflows
------------

CONTROL-CORE provides a workflow composer, known as DHGWorkflow, to create such workflows graphically.
